			<h2>Sunday, July 8, 2018 ~ Highland Grill ~ St. Paul, MN</h2>
			<p> 
				After a weekend full of vodka lemonades, pool water, and sunburn, I needed coffee and a meal that did not come from a grill. Luckily, the Pool Fiesta that my friends from college throw every Fourth of July is held in The Wilderness (Prescott, WI), which is just a 45 minute drive from St. Paul. I always say I went to school in Minneapolis, despite the campus being called Twin Cities, because I can count on one hand how many times I went to St. Paul during my four years there. But it's the hometown of Claire, one of my best friends, and she graciously met me for brunch. Claire is one of my favorite people to talk to because she is so open-minded and intelligent. Our conversations can range from politics to the supernatural to memes, and this Sunday was no different. Even the general housekeeping stuff like talking about our jobs can leave me in tears from laughing so hard. She can talk to anyone and make them feel comfortable, so I have no problem word vomiting my deepest, darkest fears to her in the middle of the Sunday brunch rush.

				Of all the problems that arose after graduating, I've found it hardest to deal with not living down the hall or within walking distance from my friends. Meeting most of your college friends on a sports team is a weird way to start your relationship with them. Your hangouts were mandatory and multiple times a week. They were the first people I saw in the morning and sometimes the last people at the end of the day. They saw me at the lowest of lows and some of the best moments of my life. At one point, I lived two apartments away from some of my best friends and I am so upset with myself for taking it for granted. Now my friends are scattered across the US and I have to coordinate months in advance to see them. At least there's been this weird phenomenon of 3/4 of my friends getting married recently, resulting in me seeing all my friends more frequently and when they're happy and celebrating.

				I have the best friends in the world and I am so lucky to have each and every one of them in my life. No matter how much time has passed between visits, we pick up right where we left off. They push me to be a better person and support me through everything. I have some of the most interesting and thought provoking conversations with them and through this blog, I'm hoping to keep a record of them and share them. This brunch with Claire was what formed the idea in my brain to make this blog mostly about my friends, the things we talk about, and the places we visit. We'll see how much of myself leaks through.

				<li>Food: 8.5/10</li> 
				<li>Coffee (from Quixotic next door): 2/10. Come on, guys. $7 for a small chai? You better have brewed the tea yourself. </li>
