		<h2>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h2>
		<h3>T.S. Eliot 1920</h3>
		<blockquote class="Dante">
			S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse <br>
			A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,<br>
			Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.<br>
			Ma percioche giammai di questo fondo<br>
			Non torno vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero,<br>
			Senza tema d’infamia ti rispondo.<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Let us go then, you and I,<br>
			When the evening is spread out against the sky<br>
			Like a patient etherized upon a table;<br>
			Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,<br>
			The muttering retreats<br>
			Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels<br>
			And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:<br>
			Streets that follow like a tedious argument<br>
			Of insidious intent<br>
			To lead you to an overwhelming question ...<br>
			Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”<br>
			Let us go and make our visit.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the room the women come and go <br>
			Talking of Michelangelo. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,<br>
			The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,<br>
			Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,<br>
			Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,<br>
			Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,<br>
			Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,<br>
			And seeing that it was a soft October night,<br>
			Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And indeed there will be time<br>
			For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,<br>
			Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;<br>
			There will be time, there will be time<br>
			To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;<br>
			There will be time to murder and create,<br>
			And time for all the works and days of hands<br>
			That lift and drop a question on your plate;<br>
			Time for you and time for me,<br>
			And time yet for a hundred indecisions,<br>
			And for a hundred visions and revisions,<br>
			Before the taking of a toast and tea.<br>
		</p>
		<p>	
			In the room the women come and go <br>
			Talking of Michelangelo. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And indeed there will be time<br>
			To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”<br>
			Time to turn back and descend the stair,<br>
			With a bald spot in the middle of my hair —<br>
			(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)<br>
			My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,<br>
			My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin —<br>
			(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)<br>
			Do I dare<br>
			Disturb the universe?<br>
			In a minute there is time<br>
			For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			For I have known them all already, known them all:<br>
			Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,<br>
			I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;<br>
			I know the voices dying with a dying fall<br>
			Beneath the music from a farther room.<br>
               So how should I presume?<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And I have known the eyes already, known them all—<br>
			The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,<br>
			And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,<br>
			When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,<br>
			Then how should I begin<br>
			To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?<br>
               And how should I presume?<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And I have known the arms already, known them all—<br>
			Arms that are braceleted and white and bare<br>
			(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)<br>
			Is it perfume from a dress<br>
			That makes me so digress?<br>
			Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.<br>
               And should I then presume?<br>
               And how should I begin?<br>

		</p>
		<p>
			Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets<br>
			And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes<br>
			Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I should have been a pair of ragged claws<br>
			Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!<br>
			Smoothed by long fingers,<br>
			Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,<br>
			Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.<br>
			Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,<br>
			Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?<br>
			But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,<br>
			Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,<br>
			I am no prophet — and here’s no great matter;<br>
			I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,<br>
			And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,<br>
			And in short, I was afraid.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And would it have been worth it, after all,<br>
			After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,<br>
			Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,<br>
			Would it have been worth while,<br>
			To have bitten off the matter with a smile,<br>
			To have squeezed the universe into a ball<br>
			To roll it towards some overwhelming question,<br>
			To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,<br>
			Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—<br>
			If one, settling a pillow by her head<br>
               Should say: “That is not what I meant at all;<br>
               That is not it, at all.”<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And would it have been worth it, after all,<br>
			Would it have been worth while,<br>
			After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,<br>
			After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—<br>
			And this, and so much more?—<br>
			It is impossible to say just what I mean!<br>
			But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:<br>
			Would it have been worth while<br>
			If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,<br>
			And turning toward the window, should say:<br>
               “That is not it at all,<br>
               That is not what I meant, at all.”<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;<br>
			Am an attendant lord, one that will do<br>
			To swell a progress, start a scene or two,<br>
			Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,<br>
			Deferential, glad to be of use,<br>
			Politic, cautious, and meticulous;<br>
			Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;<br>
			At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—<br>
			Almost, at times, the Fool.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I grow old ... I grow old ...<br>
			I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?<br>
			I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.<br>
			I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I do not think that they will sing to me.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I have seen them riding seaward on the waves<br>
			Combing the white hair of the waves blown back<br>
			When the wind blows the water white and black.<br>
			We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br>
			By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br>
			Till human voices wake us, and we drown.<br>
